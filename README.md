A creative collaborative writing app

The goal is a real time creative writing collaboration 'game'.

Each participant takes a turn to add a limited amount of text (ie: 100 words max) to write a short story. Each story will have a maximum of 10 writers and a minimum of 2 who can be anonymous or invited friends. Once each story is finished, it can be exported as a pdf or doc.

This will build the back end of the app which can then be used to further develop front ends on different platforms.

### Running the app
You must have these or a later version installed:

* Node version 10.10
* npm version 6.4.1

```
$ npm install    # install required packages for creative collab
$ npm start      # start creative collab at localhost:3000
```
